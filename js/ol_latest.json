GeoTIFF sources now have a `normalize` option.  Set `normalize: false` if you want your style expressions to work with raw floating point values instead of normalized values from 0 to 1.  The GeoTIFF source also now uses nodata values from the source imagery – so in most cases you don't need to specify this yourself.  For people configuring vector layers with styles that use custom rendering, you can now get hit detection on the rendered result.  See details on these features and other included fixes below.\r\n\r\n * [#12813](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/12813) - Do not replace icon color if image not loaded ([@mike-000](https://github.com/mike-000))\r\n * [#12870](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/12870) -
