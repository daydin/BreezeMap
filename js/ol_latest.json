7.0 release includes an impressive batch of features and fixes from over 90 pull requests.  We're excited about a new foundation for WebGL vector rendering.  The previous point rendering functionality has been extended to include lines and polygons.  The rendering API is still low level and experimental.  Future releases will include a higher level styling API.\r\n\r\nIn developing the new WebGL rendering functionality, we changed the signature for a number of methods on a helper class that had been marked as part of the API in 6.x releases.  While this is technically a breaking change, it is unlikely that applications were using this helper class, so upgrades should be straightforward.\r\n\r\nWe took advantage of the breaking change in the WebGL helper class to remove a few other deprecated parts of the API.  In addition, since Microsoft ended support for Internet Explorer a few months ago, we decided to do the same.\r\n\r\n### Backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\n#### Removal of deprecated properties and methods\r\n\r\n * The `tilePixelRatio` has been removed from the `DataTile` source.\r\n * The `imageSmoothing` option has been removed from sources.\r\n * The `undefinedHTML` option has been removed from the `MousePosition` control.\r\n * The `forEachLayerAtPixel` method has been removed from the `Map` class.\r\n * Deprecated options have been removed from the `Overlay` component.\r\n * The `labelCache` has been removed from the `ol/render/canvas.js` module.\r\n\r\n#### Internet Explorer is no longer supported\r\n\r\nPlease see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support.\r\n\r\n#### ol/webgl/Helper.js\r\n\r\nThe `Helper` constructor from the `ol/webgl/Helper.js` module is no longer part of the public API.\r\n\r\n#### ol/coordinate.js\r\n\r\nThe `toStringHDMS` function from the `ol/coordinate.js` module now formats longitude, latitude pairs so that the minutes and seconds are omitted if they are zero.  This changes the values displayed on graticules.\r\n\r\n#### ol/layer/Graticule\r\n\r\nThe default `intervals` now align with integer minutes and seconds better suited to the default label formatter.  If formatting in decimal degrees you may wish to specify custom `intervals` suited to that format.\r\n\r\n#### ol/Collection\r\n\r\nInserting with `setAt` or `insertAt` beyond the current length used to create a sparse Collection with `undefined` inserted for any missing indexes.  This will now throw an error instead.\r\n\r\n#### ol/control/MousePosition\r\n\r\nThe control will now by default keep displaying the last mouse position when the mouse leaves the viewport.  With `placeholder: '&#160;'` you can keep the old behaviour.  The `placeholder` option no longer accepts `false` as a valid value, instead simply omit the option.  The `undefinedHTML` option has been removed. You should use `placeholder` instead.\r\n\r\n#### ol/PluggableMap\r\n\r\nThe `PluggableMap` class has been removed.  If you want to create a custom map class, extend the `Map` class instead.\r\n\r\n#### ol/style/Icon and ol/style/RegularShape\r\n\r\n`ol/style/Image` and subclasses `displacement` is no longer scaled with the image.  If you previously expected this unintended behavior you should now increase the displacement when setting the scale.\r\n\r\n### List of all changes\r\n\r\nSee below for a complete list of features and
