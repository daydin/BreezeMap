These functions make it easier to work with geographic coordinates or local projections.\r\n* Improvements for WebGL Tile and Points layers.\r\n* Performance improvements on `ol/Feature`, to avoid event creation when there are no listeners.\r\n* Update of geotiff.js to v2, to fix some build issues that users reported.\r\n* Improvements to the auto-generated TypeScript types.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### New `layer.getData()` method\r\n\r\nRaster layers (static images, image tiles, data tiles) have a new `layer.getData(pixel)` method that returns the pixel data at the provided location.  The return value depends on the underlying source data type.  For example, a GeoTIFF may return a `Float32Array` with one value per band, while a PNG rendered from a tile layer will return a `Uint8ClampedArray` of RGBA values.\r\n\r\nIf you were previously using the `map.forEachLayerAtPixel()` method, you should use the new `layer.getData()` method instead.  The old method returns composite pixel values from multiple layers and is limited to RGBA values.  The new method doesn't suffer from these shortcomings and is more performant.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated `map.forEachLayerAtPixel()` method\r\n\r\nThe `map.forEachLayerAtPixel()` method has been deprecated.  It will be removed (or its behavior may change) in the next major release.  Please use the `layer.getData()` method instead.\r\n\r\n## List of all changes\r\n\r\nSee below for a complete list of features and fixes.\r\n\r\n * Update ol-mapbox-style for rich text labels support
